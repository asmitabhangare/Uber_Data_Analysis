Analysis of the Uber Pickups in New York City dataset through various visualizations.

The analysis is broken up into 3 sections:
- Data Loading and Preparation.
* Exploration and visualization of pickups from April to September 2014.
+ Conclusion.

We will analyze Uber ride data to understand various patterns and trends. The dataset includes columns for date and time, latitude and longitude (location), base, month, day, hour, and minute.

**1. Time-Based Analysis:**
   - Peak Hours for Uber Rides: We will identify the busiest hours of the day for Uber rides.

We will identify which locations have the highest number of Uber rides.
Location Trends by Time:

We will explore if certain areas have more rides at specific times of the day.
Ride Frequencies by Base:

We will compare how many rides each base handles to determine the busiest bases.
Combination of Time and Location:
Busy Locations at Different Times:
We will find out which locations are busiest during different hours of the day.
Seasonal Trends:
